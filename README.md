The project proposes a novel approach to energy consumption prediction, utilizing machine learning (ML) models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these predictions, which are crucial for effective resource management and decision-making in various sectors, replacing conventional statistical methods that struggle to capture intricate energy system patterns.

Project focuses on comparing the performance of two prominent ML techniques: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, in predicting energy consumption. Linear Regression, a conventional method in regression analysis, establishes a linear relationship between input variables and the target output. Random Forest Regression is a method that uses an ensemble of decision trees to predict a target variable independently. The final prediction is determined through a voting mechanism, enabling the capture of nonlinear relationships and effective handling of highdimensional data, especially for complex tasks like energy consumption. 

In project evaluates Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression for predicting energy consumption. Furthermore, to improve accessibility and usability, we created a mobile application using Flutter that allows users to easily forecast energy use while on the go.This integration of ML models into a user-friendly mobile interface is a huge step toward energy forecasting and empowering consumers to make informed decisions about energy consumption. Furthermore, the project aims to find the superior machine learning strategy in this domain, as well as to enhance ML-driven methodologies for energy consumption prediction, allowing for more accurate and informed energy management decisions.
